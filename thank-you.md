# Thank You!

I wanted to thank a few people for this theme:

## Inspirations

* [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/) - His [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) color scheme inspired the overall color design of this theme!
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Thanks to the Jekyll team's [minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/), I was able to get off the ground running, building my own theme. I've had experience making my own static websites before, but none that looked this good.

## Contributors

None so far! Feel free to contribute if you're interested in being added here!

## Personal Thanks

* [John Cleary](https://johnfcleary.com/) - One of my best friends. He's a designer, and he gives me small little tips in order to teach me better design. This theme will only get better and better thanks to his help.
