Welcome to Hobbies, a Jekyll theme made for developers who want to say a little more than "Hello World!"

Hobbies is inspired by the minimal aesthetic of [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and the colors of [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy). A warm "Thank You!" to these inspirations.

The theme should always be considered a **BETA** product, and large design and aesthetic changes may always occur on the theme. As I continue to grow up, my sense of style and design changes, and so this theme will change along with it! Any design I deem as a final "product" will be put into its own repository.
