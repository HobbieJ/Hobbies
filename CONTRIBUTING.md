# Repository Contribution Guide

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for the code, I'm happy to take them.

Keep in mind that all contributions are subject to my approval; there's a reason they're called *suggestions*. I love community help, and will always appreciate, support, and credit it, but at the end of the day, the software is hosted on my GitHub profile, and I'm very protective about my software's vision.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests can be submitted either through GitHub or through Git itself.

I have two basic rules for submitting pull requests:

* **One Branch Per Issue** - I make branches that focus on one specific issue I'm trying to fix. For instance, if I were making changes to the README, I would make a branch named `readme`. If I were trying to fix a bug, I might name my branch `bug-fix`, etc.
* **Titles Are Tiny, Descriptions are Detailed** - A good general title that describes the basic issue being fixed or enhancement being made is preferred. It helps to know why code wanted to be pulled at a glance. For instance, `Updating README` is a good title, as well as, `Fixing Auto-Correct Bug`.
However descriptions are the best place to dump all details that you can about your changes. I work in IT, and when asking my clients to detail what's happening to their computer when I'm helping over the phone, I always ask them to explain things so well to me that I'm cringing. If I'm cringing at the detail in your pull request, you're doing it perfectly. Helpful things to include are what files changed, why, and what kinds of changes were made, (code that breaks other code potentially, style changes, performance changes, etc.).

## Issues

Issues are a great way to alert me to bugs in my software, or suggest new features without typing a line of code.

There are currently three different issue tags:

* **bug** - These are for bugs that don't break the software completely. If you found an action that isn't intended, but doesn't break everything, this is the tag.
* **critical** - These are for bugs that break everything. These should be completely rare, as I test the software before publishing it to *master*, but mistakes can always happen. These are **always** given first priority.
* **enhancement** - Feature requests, style changes, pretty much anything and everything else. If you have an idea for the code, feel free to add them to Issues using this tag. **Note:** Not all enhacements suggested may be taken.

## Thank You!

Finally, I want to thank you for contributing to my code. Whether it's through a suggestion or code changes, your help in making my software better at the end of the day is always appreciated. Thank you!
